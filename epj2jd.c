**  Julian Epoch to Julian Date.
**
**  This function is part of the International Astronomical Union's
**  SOFA (Standards Of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.
**
**  Status:  support function.
**
**  Given:
**     epj      double    Julian Epoch (e.g. 1996.8D0)
**
**  Returned:
**     djm0     double    MJD zero-point: always 2400000.5
**     djm      double    Modified Julian Date
**
**  Note:
**
**     The Julian Date is returned in two pieces, in the usual SOFA
**     manner, which is designed to preserve time resolution.  The
**     Julian Date is available as a single number by adding djm0 and
**     djm.
