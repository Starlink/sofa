 1) An error in the C version of the DAT routine was corrected. The error, not 
    present in the Fortran version, applied only to dates in the first half of 
    1972. The consequences were platform-dependent; in the test environment the
    error left the results unaffected, but with other compilers and computers, 
    wrong answers or even arithmetical exceptions were possible.

 1) A bug affecting the routines iauFk52h and iauH2fk5 has been corrected. This
    caused erroneous proper motions (and also radial velocity) to be returned.
 
 2) The testbed t_sofa_c.c has been updated to reflect the changes to iauFk52h 
    and iauH2fk5.

 3) In the C header file sofa.h, an used reference has been removed.

 4) In the C functions iauFk5hip, iauGmst00, iauObl80 and iauObl06, use of the 
    ANSI C language feature "unary plus" has been eliminated, to avoid 
    difficulties with older compilers.
